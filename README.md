# Globing: cheap High-Altitude balloon for everyone

## Abstract
This high altitude balloon (HAB) construction kit project is designed for an organization such as a high school to provide hands-on science lessons to students between the ages of 12-18. The high schools will run the project for one academic year, during which the students will learn basic physics, regulations, as well as how to assemble the different components of the balloon. This kit allows us to build a HAB equipped with everything necessary to monitor and observe data such as altitude, temperature and pressure of the first layers of the atmosphere (up to 36km high). This kit adjusts the budget to make the realization of the practice much more affordable.
